 tongtong swings his stick with star at the tip.
 tongtong swings his stick and the light comes out from the stick.
 a wall clock makes an angry face and stands up.
 a wall clock swings his hands and talks. tongtong is listening to the wall clock.
 tongtong is putting his finger on his chin and looking down at the stick.
