 Eddy is now trying to see the scene through the telescope. However because of the snowy weather Eddy can't see the landscape very well. Only for much snow and big trees are possible to be seen.
 After watching the scene Eddy asks to Petty what shall we do. Petty seems that Petty doesn't know how to cope with this situation either.
 Petty and Eddy are discussing how to cope with this situation. They really hope to go outside and pick up Pororo and Crong. However because of the severe snowy weather Petty hesitates to go anywhere.
 It is evident that any person can't go outside because of the weather. In this situation Eddy makes interesting idea by staring the picture.
 By holding the picture Eddy explains that they can go on airship and get close to the mountains.
