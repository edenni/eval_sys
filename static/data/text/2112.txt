 Eddy has a big smile. Eddy says that loopy is going to throw a party. Shortly after Eddy finished talking Pororo shows interested in the event and comes to Eddy.
 Pororo says that Pororo will go to the party with Eddy. Eddy is little bit surprised at Pororo.
 Eddy asks to Crong if Crong could join the party.
 Crong feels happy and tells Eddy that Crong will go to the party as well.
 As soon as Crong accepts Eddy's proposal Eddy and Pororo leave the house.
