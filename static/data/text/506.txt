 loopy is dribbling to the opponent's goalpost that poby is keeping
 because the ball went to strange direction pororo and eddy laughed
 eddy and pororo thought that loopy missed the chance to score as friends expected
 loopy celebrates loopy as petty got a score
 pororo and eddy is hard to believe what just happened that loopy made a fantastic goal
