 The toy frog is continually sitting on the round bottom glass flask. Pororo and Crong request the toy frog not to sit on it.
 In spite of Pororo and Crong's request the toy frog is continually sitting on the round bottom glass flask.
 The toy frog finally jumps out of the round bottom glass flask. The round bottom glass flask falls down to the floor with right hand rotation.
 Pororo and Crong are surprised. Then Pororo quickly checks the round bottom glass flask whether it works normally.
 The toy frog is continually jumping up and down on the desk. It ribs the Pororo and Crong. Pororo is really upset.
