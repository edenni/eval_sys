 Poby says hi to Harry and check whether Harry startled Poby.
 As Poby yawns Poby is disappointed. At that time one idea comes up in Harry's mind.
 Harry perches on Harry's nose and proposes a song to wake Poby up.
 Poby repeats the word song.
 Harry flies from Poby's nose to his house as Harry says yes.
