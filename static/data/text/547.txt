 Eddy is reading a book in front of a bookshelf.
 The sun is setting and the roof of a house is covered in snow.
 The sun is setting and Eddy comes out of the house and runs to somewhere.
 Eddy is hiding behind a huge rock and looks at the ice rink. The sun is setting.
 Eddy moves on to the ice rink holding skates on eddy hand. The sun is setting.
