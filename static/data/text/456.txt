 The land is covered with snow. There is a snowman on the snow. Crong pororo and a pink seal walks along the road which is connected to a house.
 A toy duck towels and other stuffs are scattered on the floor. Pororo gets embarrassed.
 Pororo stands beside an open door. Pororo gets angry.
 Pororo puts his hands on his waist and talks something. Then pororo leaves the room and closes the door.
 The sky is dark outside. In the middle of the snow covered forest there is a house.
