 A fish bite instantly starts and poby pulls his fishing nod as hard as Poby can
 a fish as big as half of poby's face with blue back and white stomach is caught by poby's good fishing skill
 petty praised poby with her surprise at poby's fantastic fishing skill
 poby is shy to hear petty's compliment just scratching his head
 Poby is under delusion that petty likes him made by a small compliment
