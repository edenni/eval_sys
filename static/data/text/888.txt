 Eddy is disappointed in front of a door. poby shakes crong head looking downward.
 Eddy walks away from a door being determined.
 Eddy walks to a snowed house through a path. There are snowed fields and trees all around Eddy. Eddy opens up the door and pops crong head in.
 Eddy's head is in through an open door. Pororo and Crong see Eddy. There is a Christmas tree between Pororo and Crong.
 Crong is in front of a bed waving crong hands with red gloves on. Pororo is holding a yellow star decoration and also waving crong right hand. Between them there is a Christmas tree.
