 it is morning. the weather is shiny. there are mountains.
 among the mountains and trees there is a spaceship.
 the green is fixing the spaceship with his hands.
 the light blue is connecting two wires. the purple is watching him fixing.
 the purple is doubtful about the blue. the purple blinks his eyes.
