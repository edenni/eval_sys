 it is a dark night. it is a Poby's house. Harry keeps singing.
 Poby looks somewhere. Poby seems to hate to hear a Harry's song.
 Harry stand on Poby's table. and Harry sing a song happily.
 Poby is yawning. Poby looks tired so Poby wants to go to bed.
 Poby doesn't endure anymore. So Poby speak to Harry.
