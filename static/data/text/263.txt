 Eddy is finally coming out hiding at snow. Eddy seems satisfied.
 Loopy is walking toward Eddy. A small telescope is rotating to find Loopy. After Eddy watches Loopy Eddy is hiding to the snow again.
 Eddy secretly steals a glance through his telescope with his left eyes. While glancing Eddy is murmuring something.
 While Eddy steals a glance Eddy pushes the button on the telescope with his right thumbs.
 Loopy is muttering to herself with her two arms rise up and down. Behind Loopy there are two trees covered with snow.
