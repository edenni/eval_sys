 poby set his camera to take a picture
 the dragon holds a cake with his both hands and the others are standing both side of the dragon the picture is taken by camera
 the dragon's hot breath is unconsciously exhaled and burned his friends
 The dragon said sorry to his friends for blackening them by his sneezing
 the dusk is cast in the sky and the dragon has to go now
