 everyone except for loopy can not believe what Loopy said about her magic soup
 Loopy holds two cups of magic running soup in her both hands
 loopy offers to drink her soup that make her friends run all day
 pororo and crong took loopy's magic soup and hold a cup with full of soup
 pororo and crong seem to resign to loop's belief in her magic soup and decide to drink it
