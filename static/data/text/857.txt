 crong still tries to persuade loopy that his story is true
 however loopy is disappointed in crong and leaves pororo's house
 the picture shows loopy's house from black sky above it
 loopy read a fairy tale and yawned on her bed her toy bear is on her bed covered by blanket
 loopy closed her book and put it on the table to go to sleep
