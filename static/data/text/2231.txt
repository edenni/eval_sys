 pororo and crong seem to resign to loop's belief in her magic soup and decide to drink it
 right after drinking the magic soup pororo and crong is standing up and running
 while pororo and crong run around the other friends looking at them
 while pororo and crong are running around the other friends are looking at pororo and crong and loopy believes her magic soup actually working
 loopy's friends laugh because loopy is deceived by pororo and crong's acting
