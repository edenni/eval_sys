 eddy is saying thanks through the window of his space ship.
 the yellow space ship turns away. it goes away from eddy's space ship.
 the space ship is heading back towards the earth.
 everyone is happy to see something in the sky. they are waving at the sky.
 eddy is getting off the space ship. everyone is approaching to eddy.
