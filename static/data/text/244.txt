 when everyone joys loopy's bread someone alters the mood by saying oh yeah
 petty is still curious about their pop visit and asks again looking around her friends
 pororo is holding a piece of bitten bread on his right hand
 everyone seems like they forget what they were going to ask about
 everyone seems like they forget what they were going to ask about no one said what  is was about
