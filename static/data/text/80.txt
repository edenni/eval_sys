 The dragon watches the robot juggling and counting numbers and gives a big applaud.
 The dragon claps hands and says the robot is good.
 With smile the dragon says it is an amazing job.
 The dragons tells the robot that he is really hungry.
 A lot of apples fall on the floor. It is time to have supper.
